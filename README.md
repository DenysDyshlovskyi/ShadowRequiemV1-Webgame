# ShadowRequiemV1-Webgame

A simple unfinished turn-based strategic fighter webgame project. All assets made by me, some code written by willing contributors. Art and animations are not free to use, but the code is.

	gameplay loop (the game itself, aka the Combat code);
	login;
    code redeeming system;
    tutorial;
    credits list;
    character shop;
    currency;
❌Unfinished features:
    leaderboard;
    settings;
    mobile ui support;
